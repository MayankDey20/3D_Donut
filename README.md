This Python script uses numpy and matplotlib to create a 3D spinning donut animation. It generates the coordinates of a donut shape and applies rotation to simulate spinning. The donut is visualized using matplotlib's 3D plotting capabilities, and the FuncAnimation function animates the rotation by updating the plot in a loop.
You can play around with it by modifying it according to your own prefernces:
Change Donut Size:

Modify the constants in the generate_donut function to adjust the size of the donut. For example, changing the 2 in (2 + np.cos(phi)) will resize the donut.
Adjust Rotation Speed:

Change the frames parameter in FuncAnimation or adjust the interval to speed up or slow down the rotation. Increasing the number of frames or decreasing the interval will make the rotation smoother and faster.
Modify Color:

Update the color parameter in the plot_surface method to change the donut's color. You can use color names or hexadecimal color codes.
Change Lighting and Edge Color:

Modify the edgecolor parameter in plot_surface to change the color of the donut's edges or remove them by setting it to None.
Adjust Plot Limits:

Change the set_xlim, set_ylim, and set_zlim methods to adjust the boundaries of the plot and fit the donut within a different range.
Experiment with Rotation Axis:

Modify the rotation calculation in generate_donut to rotate around different axes or create complex rotation effects by combining rotations around multiple axes.
Add Additional Plots or Annotations:

Add other matplotlib plotting functions to overlay additional shapes, text, or annotations on the plot for a more detailed visualization.
Use Different 3D Plotting Libraries:

Explore other libraries like Mayavi or Plotly for more advanced 3D plotting and interactive features.
